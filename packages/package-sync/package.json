It will include all packages you currently have installed in the `~/.atom/packages` directory. The package list can be edited from there if you wish to add or remove any packages from the list.\n\nCalling `Create Package List` will *not* overwrite a pre-existing package list. If you want to start over, you have to manually delete `~/atom/packages.cson` and then call `Create Package List` to create it anew.\n\n**Editing the Package List**\n\nYou can edit the package list at any time by opening it with the `Open Package List` command. It will open the `~/.atom/packages.cson` file in a new Atom tab.\n\n**Synchronizing your Packages**\n\nOnce you have the package list set the way you want, any time you wish to ensure that you have all of your required packages, you can execute the `Sync` command.\n\n**`packages.cson`**\n\nThe `packages.cson` file follows the format:\n\n```coffee\n'packages': [\n  'foo'\n  'bar'\n  'baz'\n]\n```\n\nWhere the contents of the array is a list of packages to ensure are installed.\n\n### Configuration\n\n* `createOnChange` &mdash; Create the package list when packages are installed or removed via the Atom settings. You must restart Atom after installing Package Sync for this setting to take effect, and it works best when paired with the `forceOverwrite` setting.\n* `forceOverwrite` &mdash; Forces the `create-package-list` command to overwrite the `packages.cson` if it exists.\n\n### Commands\n\n* `package-sync:create-package-list` &mdash; Creates the `~/.atom/packages.cson` file if it does not already exist\n* `package-sync:open-package-list` &mdash; Opens the `~/.atom/packages.cson` in a new tab\n* `package-sync:sync` &mdash; Syncs between the package list and the installed packages\n\n### Keybindings\n\nNo keybindings are configured by default for the commands in this package.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright &copy; 2014-2016 by [Lee Dohm](http://www.lee-dohm.com), [Lifted Studios](http://www.liftedstudios.com).
